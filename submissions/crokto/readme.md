#Business Card 60%
by Crokto

##Concept
A fully functional keyboard, almost entirely assembled by JLCPCB, only requiring the USB port to be added on. This combination of low per-unit price and effort allows it to be given away freely without much cost, as with a business card.

Meant to be operated while held in hand, serving as something in-between a phone's touchscreen keyboard and a full desktop keyboard.

Created a (mostly fictional) website to go with the business card.

JLC gerber & PCBA files are included, all that's needed is to solder on an HRO-TYPE-C-31-M-13 connector - can use this video as reference on soldering this type of connector https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IOdTOevj2k
