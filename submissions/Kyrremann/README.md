This is my business card aka the keychuks! The keyboard can be split in two, and connected with 6 individual wires to
form a split board, or used as nunchuks when you're bored.

The inital idea was to try my hands at a split board, but the size made it a bit too hard for me, so instead I went
with something between. Where you can split it, but you have to make your own 6 pin wire, and solder it.
