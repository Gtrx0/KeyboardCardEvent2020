One of the more interesting developments in custom keyboard kits in the last few years has been the abundance of through hole component kits. Starting with the Planck THK and then the Plaid, there are now many kits in various layouts to suit all corners of the hobby.

The great thing about these kits is that anyone with basic soldering skills and equipment can build an entire board from a bare PCB and bag of components.

This PCB business card continues this trend with a 4 key Plaid style macropad.
